<h1>Pen Mating vs. Flock Mating</h1>

<p>I got my first aviary as a boy. My first budgerigars just bred in the
flight (flock mating). When I started with show budgerigars I switched
over to breeding in breeding cages (pen mating). Pen mating is the common
practice for breeders of show budgerigars.</p>

<p>In the mean time I finished school and university. Then came the full time
job and I stopped breeding birds. I've met my future wife and now I've
already moved to my second apartment. Apartments aren't ideal for keeping
birds certainly not fairly noisy ones as budgerigars. We are thinking of
buying or building a house. I am thinking of breeding show budgerigars
again once the house is in order.</p>

<p>So I'm looking around a bit and one aspect I'm very worried about is
fertility. It already was a serious problem when I was still active and it
still seems to be a major issue. Something else I'm worried about when I
start again is the time I can spend with my budgerigars during the day.
I'm not ready to quit my day job for the hobby. So I started thinking
again at the old days and wondered if flock mating in stead of pen mating
could be used for breeding top show budgerigars.</p>

<p>I've tried to think of all the arguments pro and contra for each of these
two methods.</p>

<p><b>1</b>. Pen mating lets you choose the mates while flock mating introduces free
choice of mates. You may be pro-choice and against forced marriages but
when you're trying to breed top budgerigars you don't want to waste you
excellent cock on the wrong hen (or vice versa). Nevertheless you might be
able to select a few cocks and hens that match each other enough to use
flock mating. So you can have some sort of guided mating even with flock
mating. Free choice of mates does lead to more fertile pairs since there
is a stronger pair bond and both mates get into breeding condition
together. Some top breeders that practice pen mating often let cocks and
hens fly in the same flight. When they see a pair formed and they match
visually and pedigree wise they will put them straight in the breeding
cage. This brings the good aspects of free choice of mates to pen mating.</p>

<p><b>2</b>. Flock mating is more natural for budgerigars. I think there is little
argument against this. The question is if 'more natural' necessary means
'better'.</p>

<p><b>3</b>. Pen mating avoids adultery and makes for perfect pedigree records. This
is a valid argument in favour of pen mating. I find this argument in
combination with argument 1 the most compelling.<br />
With flock mating you can still be almost sure of the mother and when you
observe your pairs you will also be fairly sure of the father. But are you
sure enough? Combined with the fact that you have less control over the
formed pairs you cannot plan and assess pairs as much as you would like.</p>

<p><b>4</b>. Pairs stimulate each other to breed so flock mating should result in
better breeding results (also as a result of argument 1.). Imitation is
strong in the behaviour of animals. Hens and cocks alike are stimulated
when they see others breed. By using wired cages pen breeders try to
take advantage of this.</p>

<p><b>5</b>. Flock mating require less time to observe your hens and cocks for
breeding condition. When a cock and a hen are both in breeding condition
they will find each other in the flock mating method and start breeding.</p>

<p><b>6</b>. Pen mating excludes fighting between pairs. One problem with flock
mating is that two (or more)  hens will probably fight over the same nest
box. Also more bickering at the feeding place can be expected. This may
possibly lead to more injuries. On the other hand there is more room for a
hen to flee if it is chased by the cock (or vice versa).</p>

<p><b>7</b>. Flock mating gives the birds more room to fly and hence these birds
will be better able to keep in shape during the breeding season. This does
also mean that the parents have to fly more between the feeding place and
feeding the chicks. This could be a problem if your birds can't fly
properly. Also chicks leaving the nest box will take a bigger dive. Once
the chicks have left the nest box the parents have to look more for them.
If one of the parents becomes aggressive towards its chicks they have more
room to flee. Moreover there is more distraction for the jealous parent.
If the breeding flights are large enough you can also leave the chicks
longer with their parents to ease the weaning process.</p>

<p><b>8</b>. Flock mating introduces more quarrels which gives the birds that extra
movement and distraction. Of course this can also mean that a mating pair
is disturbed so flock mating should be practiced in relatively large
flights. You will probably need more room for flock mating compared to an
equal number of pairs in pen mating.</p>

<p><b>9</b>. With flock mating pairs can help each other. I've seen this in action
myself when in my aviary a opaline cock also fed the hen and
chicks of his son in the nest box adjacent to his own.</p>

<p><b>10</b>. With flock mating you have less cages/flights to attend to per pair
(but not less room). This can save some time: e.g. you have to refresh
less dinking fountains. Don't move to flock mating just because you have
too little time for the pairs you want to breed. Personally I believe the
time saved will be quite small.</p>

<p>The arguments aren't clearly pro flock mating nor clearly pro pen mating.
With this article I just wanted to point out that there is another method
next to pen mating. You'll have to look at the arguments and decide for
yourself what's best in your situation. If you decide to switch from one
system to another do it gradually so you can experience the difference in
person and make a better decision. Maybe you don't wan't to switch but
hopefully you got some ideas from these arguments.</p>

<p>If you should decide to take up flock mating there are some things to keep
in mind. First up make sure the breeding flights are big enough. Each pair
should have enough room to mate without disturbance. Remember that when
the pair is preparing the next round the young from the previous round are
still in the breeding flight. Also make far more nest boxes available then
the number of pairs to avoid too much bickering between the hens.
In order to minimise the negative consequences of flock mating mentioned
in arguments 1 and 3 don't use too many pairs per breeding flight. On the
other hand for some of the advantages there should be enough pairs in the
breeding flights. I feel you should have minimal 3 pairs per breeding
flight. Once you have more then 6 pairs I think things start to get
complicated to retrace fatherhood. Moreover you will have to find so many
cocks and hens that all match.</p>

<p>I wouldn't recommend putting just one pair in the breeding flight and then
later adding more pairs. Start of with at least 2 pairs otherwise the
lonely pair will see the entire breeding flight as their territory and
certainly will be disturbed when introducing new birds.</p>

<p>There might be a way to encourage a pairing of a certain cock to a
particular hen. For instance by first putting them some period together in
a cage before introducing them in the breeding flight. But there are no
guarantees.</p>
