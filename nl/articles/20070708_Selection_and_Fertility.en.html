<h1>Fertility and Selection</h1>

<p>There are two aspects here. There is the important effect of fertility on
selection but I will warm up by discussing selection for better fertility.</p>

<p>Fertility is known in many species to be a difficult trait to select on. In
expert-speak: a low heritability. The success in mice experiments had
varying results. Now there certainly is a genetic component to fertility.
It's no accident that birds from certain studs are difficult to breed. So
it certainly is possible to select on fertility. But do you want to select
on fertility? There are so many other traits to consider when selecting. Do
you really want to favour a lesser hen with superior fertility over a better
hen? After all fertility is not a show quality. I will get back to that in
the second part of this article. For now lets assume a certain level of
fertility in your stud is desirable.</p>

<p>Since fertility has such a low heritability it is very important to look at
the breeding records of ancestors and other relatives. Fertility is a very
complex trait and is strongly determined by outside influences. For
instance if a hen is disturbed at night and has difficulties
finding back the nest then the eggs will have cooled and the hatching rate will
be lower. Another example: badly attached perches in the breeding cage will
result in more clear eggs. So when selecting on fertility it is very
important to keep the environment as constant and uniform as possible. You
can't compare the fertility of a pair breeding in winter with a pair
breeding in summer when they are housed in an outside aviary. Temperature,
lighting intensity, hours of sunshine a day, rain, ... is different.</p>

<p>To summarize, keep records and heavily use information of relatives and
have an environment (housing, feeding, management routine, ...) that is as
uniform as possible.</p>

<p>Fertility is not a show quality, so do we need it in our stud? Everyone
will agree that a minimal fertility is required: on average you need to
breed two children from each parent just to save your stud from extinction.
But with this minimum you can't cull, so there is no selection.
From the theory of selection you can get an idea on what the quality will
be of the best chick if the "average" chick has a quality of 0 (this is
statistics, so these are averages over a whole lot of pairs):</p>
<br />
<table>
<tr align="right"><td>Number of chicks:</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr align="right"><td>Quality of the best chick:</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>&nbsp;43</td><td>&nbsp;67</td><td>&nbsp;84</td><td>&nbsp;97</td><td>&nbsp;107</td><td>&nbsp;115</td><td>&nbsp;122</td><td>&nbsp;128</td><td>&nbsp;134</td><td>&nbsp;138</td><td>&nbsp;143</td><td>&nbsp;147</td><td>&nbsp;150</td><td>&nbsp;153</td><td>&nbsp;156</td><td>&nbsp;159</td><td>&nbsp;162</td><td>&nbsp;164</td><td>&nbsp;167</td></tr>
</table>
<br />
<p>I won't bore you with the mathematical and statistical background of these
numbers, but let's just demonstrate intuitively: Say you breed 4 chicks
from a pair. From this pair one of the 4 is the best. Suppose you suddenly
discover you moved an egg from this pair and that you've got a 5th chick.
This 5th chick can be better or worse than the best one of the 4 others. If
it's better, then the quality of the best chick from 5 is higher than that
of 4 chicks. In case the 5th chick is worse, the quality of the best chick
from 5 is equal to the best chick from 4. So you can only win if you breed
more. Which means that statistically, with a great number of pairs, that
extra chick per pair will get you better quality.</p>

<p>Now intuitively you can understand that the chance that this extra chick is
better than all the previous ones is smaller when there are more previous
chicks. This is also reflected in the numbers above. The more chicks you
breed, the less effect that extra chick per pair has. For instance chick 20
gives an increase of 3 points (from 164 to 157), while chick 5 gives an
increase of 13 points (from 84 to 97).</p>

<p>Breeding more chicks allows you to be more rigorous in culling. So you'll
have better parents next breeding season. And this then reflects in better
chicks next year.</p>

<p>But you have to balance the benefits and the costs. If you already breed 10
chicks per pair over two rounds you probably don't want to select on
fertility. The extra effort will not be proportional to the benefits.
But if you breed 3 chicks per pair getting the fertility up will allow
you to make bigger steps each year. The difference between 3 (67 points) and
6 (107 points) is huge.</p>

<p>The choice as always is yours, but I hope I've helped you in making a more
informed judgment.</p>
