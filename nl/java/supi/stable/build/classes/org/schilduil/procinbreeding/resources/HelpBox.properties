helptext=<H1>The Schilduil Proc Inbreeding Help Page<H1><P>To use the Schilduil Proc Inbreeding program you need a pedigree file. Based on that pedigree file the inbreeding and the additive genetic relationship is calculated.</P><H3>Pedigree file</H3><P>The pedigree file is an ordinary text file where each line represents an individual. Here's an example:<BR/><BR/><TT># Parents<BR/>FATHER<BR/>MOTHER ? ?<BR/># Offspring<BR/>SKY FATHER MOTHER The first chick of the pair<BR/>COBALT FATHER MOTHER The second chick of the pair</TT><BR/><BR/>The first column of each line is the name or code of the individual. It may not contain any spaces nor tabs.<BR/>The second and third columns are for the parents. The columns must be seperated by one or more spaces or tabs. If you the parents are unknown you can omit them or you can put a questionmark (?) for each unknown parent.<BR/>Anything after the first three columns is considered comment and you can put anything you like.<BR/>Blank lines are allowed and lines starting with a hash (#) are ignored, use them to put comments in your pedigree file. Lines that start with an at (@) are not allowed.</P><P>The SchildUil Proc Inbreeding program can get it's pedigree files from both the file system (<TT>CTRL-O</TT>) or from the internet (<TT>CTRL-U</TT>). The menu items for these two can be found in the File menu.</P><P>Once the pedigree file is correctly parsed it will show the relationship matrix.</P><P>You can export it to a CSV file. This file can be opened by a spreadsheet program like OpenOffice Calc or Excel.</P><P>More information about the calculation can be found at:<BR/><A HREF="http://www.schilduil.org/articles/index.php?article=20060623_Calculating_inbreeding.en.html">http://www.schilduil.org/articles/index.php?article=20060623_Calculating_inbreeding.en.html</A></P>
