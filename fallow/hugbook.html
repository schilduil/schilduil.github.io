Fallows</a> are my favorite budgerigars. A very interesting combination
that few people have seen so far is the Double Factor Spangle Fallow in
Green or in Blue. Visually these budgerigars are completely free of suffusion
and resemble the sexlinked Ino mutations. It will be very interesting to
evaluate whether these birds are recognized on the show bench as Fallows.
Fooling around with judges is fun.

<br>The Fallows together with the Crests are
the most ridiculed budgerigars in the fancy. People indeed claim that the
Fallow gene smashes size and type and breeding of Fallows is a waste of
time. This is of course an old wives` tale and proves only the level of

the Green as well as in the Blue and  Yellowface series of colors and
in combination with <span lang="de-ch">most of the</span> mutations. The wing color
of Fallows is described as pale brownish grey and the body color is gradually

is believed that the word “fallow” is (exclusively) used to describe uncultivated
land that is allowed to idle during the growing season. A classical memory
problem. However, it is a nonsense to apply this particular meaning to
the pigment of budgerigars because <b><i><font color="#FF0000">“fallow"

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">SM: My birdroom is 60ft by 20ft (18m x
6m). It is a brick construction with two internal flights. The 48 breeding
cages measure each 24in x 18in x 15in (64cm x 45cm x 37cm) and the corresponding
outside nestboxes are 6in x 6in x 10in (15cm x 15cm x 25cm).

<br>I do not believe that my birds are suffering
by being housed inside. Lighting is provided by fluorescent lamps and is
constant throughout the year (14 hours). Budgerigars, unlike many other
species of birds, are not susceptible to light stimulation. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: We have two birdrooms. One birdroom
with 8 breeding cages each 30in x 18in x 16in (75cm x 45cm x 40cm) and
an internal f<font color="#111111">light measuring 8ft x 5ft x 7ft (2.4m x 1.5m x 2.2m). Nestboxes
are 10in x 6in x 10in (25cm x 15cm x 25cm). I am a great believer in true
light fluorescent lamps that provide a spectrum similar to natural light
including the required UV light. The day length is adjusted to stimulate
natural cycles. To optimize the breeding of birds you have to understand
the role of circadian rhythms and photoperiods too. The timing of the artificial
light is as important as the quality of the light. In general I suggest
that the photoperiod is gradually increased from 9 to 10 hours to 15 to
16 hours a day within 6 to 8 weeks. Less than 9 hours of light per day
appeared to abolish breeding condition. The second birdroom is an external
flight with a connected small inside flight to guarantee shelter during
the night from e.g. cats. Birds always move into the inside flight over
night. During winter</font>time all birds are kept inside. It is feasible to condition
budgerigars in a way that the first chicks are hatched precisely on the
ring issue date if required, starting for example conditioning in September.
If lighting is kept constant over several years birds will breed very well
the first year but fail to breed in the second year. This observation I
made at the very beginning in the fancy and I of course blamed the birds
or the former owner of the birds. Depending on the distance of the breeding
cage from the artificial light source you can even direct the sex ratio
in the clutches (!). Move the cage closer to the source and you will have
more cocks.
<br>We do not use “ladders” to allow molting
birds to reach perches. In fact even molting birds should be able to fly.
The “ladders” found in many birdrooms are there to allow the overweight
monstrous show potatoes to walk to the perches as most of them cannot fly
anymore. </font>

Normally I check nestboxes twice everyday. However when eggs are due to
hatch I check more often to make sure that hatched chicks are being fed
properly. A record card is attached to each breeding cage and notes are
made about fertile, addled or damaged eggs. My feeding routine takes about
3 hours a day. Water is changed every day and cleaning is done every week,
mostly at weekends. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: In the inside birdroom the light is
turned on every morning and turned off every evening by a timer. The exact
time depends on the condition of the birds and on the season. Our birds
are fed every day and sufficient water is provided too but we do not stick
to a defined routine. Our birds know that they will receive a delicious
piece of greenfood when we enter the birdroom, but they do not know whether
this will be at 6.00 a.m. or at 6.00 p.m. Nestboxes with chicks or with
eggs due to hatch are inspected twice a week and records are updated accordingly.
In our notebook we record the age of the breeding birds, the size of the
clutches, the number of chicks hatched, the number of chicks fledged and
the amount of rounds performed. We have individual files for all birds
specifying all the details of the birds and the number and quality of the
offspring. We do not mark eggs and we aim to cause as little disturbance
as possible. Most of the time in the birdroom we simply sit there and observe.
We spend a lot of time with particularly sympathetic youngsters. The “lazy
breeder” method, also called “deep litter” method, is preferred. We do
not think that a weekly disinfection is appropriate. </font>

composed of millet (Japanese, White, Yellow, Panicum), plain canary and
grouts. Grit, cuttlefish and mineral blocks are always available. Hardboiled
eggs are mixed with breadcrumbs and used as softfood every day during the

the year. Entrodex (probiotic) is added to the softfood. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: We feed a commercial basic seed mixture
of canary seed and different millets. If possible the birds get greenfood
everyday. Our tap water is of very good quality and not chemically treated.
Carrots or apples are distributed in the flights regularly. Mineral blocks
and softfood are available for breeding pairs only. A commercial softfood
is given to birds with chicks starting 2 to 4 days before chicks are due
to hatch and removed after the chicks are fledged. We do not add vitamins
to the food and the concept of stimulating a bird’s (or a human’s) natural
intestinal flora is of course a marketing gag and nothing else (if your
birds are not treated with antibiotics every month). It was shown that
a raw protein content of 10% in the seed is sufficient for nonbreeding
birds [see reference 1]. Also it is not necessary to supplement the food
with the most critical amino acid lysine. We believe that the situation
is different in breeding birds rearing a dozen chicks and we provide enough
softfood with lecithin. </font>

quality that they are reacting more sensitively to invading pathogens as
compared to wild budgerigars. I use Ramizol for treating trichomoniasis,
Nystatin to control fungal infections, Virkon S to kill viruses, Chloromycetin
to treat eye infections, Ivermectin to fight scaly mite and Mega-S to fight
megabacteria. Amoxycillin and Cephalexin are used to irradiate bacteria. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" color="#111111" face="Arial">FM: We do not treat
sick birds with antibiotics or other medicine. We believe that the elimination
rather than the cure of sick birds is a must if you plan to breed with
your birds. Selection of healthy birds is the superlative medicine chest.
It is clear from experiments with mice that a successful response to a
pathogen (virus, fungus, bacterium, yeast) in a stud is directly related
to the diversity of certain molecules found on key cells of the immune
system. These molecules are required to initiate an appropriate immune
response and appear to prevent inbreeding by directing the mate choice
as proven in mice and also in humans (see reference 6) to&nbsp; prevent
matings between genetically similar individuals. Reproductive mechanisms
are varied and range from selective fertilization to selective abortion.
In inbred studs the diversity of these molecules is decreased. It is therefore
not uncommon that a high percentage of the birds in an inbred stud can
not fight e.g. a particular strain of bacteria and will eventually die
if not treated with high doses of antibiotics. Wide (and wild) application
of antibiotics is directly responsible for the development of resistances
in bacteria and fungi. The problems of Megabacteria (a yeast) are maybe
due to a superinfection in the gut by bacteria (they open the gate) followed
by the multiplication of normally inoffensive Megabacteria. Similar yeast
infections are observed in immunocompromised human patients or not yet
immunocompetent children. It is therefore not surprising that newly hatched
chicks are very vulnerable and it is heartbreaking to hear that plenty
of budgie breeders observe high juvenile mortality these days without apparent
cause. The only scientifically (not psychologically) sound advice is to
start from scratch with budgerigars that are selected for health. Maybe
one should not buy budgerigars from breeders with a big medicine chest
and a known history of Megabacteriosis. Megabacteria can be eliminated
from the gut of your birds for a short period of time but they can never
be irradicated from the environment of your budgerigars if you do not keep
birds under quasi sterile conditions. Humans, especially children need
fresh air and sunshine to be healthy&nbsp; and happy. It is not heresy
to claim similar conditions for birds, especially breeding birds.

<br>French molt is a
widely distributed and devastating viral disease in budgerigars. Interestingly
it is often found that not all chicks in an infected nest show symptoms.
This may indicate that these unaffected chicks have the appropriate molecules
on their cells of the immune system to keep in check or eliminate the virus.
Budgerigars that have been suffering from French molt should never be used
for breeding. These birds can recover completely and produce healthy chicks
but they will transmit half of their suboptimal set of molecules to their
offspring and may ruin your stud within few years if another outbreak of
French molt occurs. Viral diseases can never be cured by antibiotics and
you can anticipate the effect of antibiotics during viral infections if
bacteria, important and protective bacteria are removed.
<br>Outbreaks of French
molt and Megabacteria can have disastrous effects in studs that have not
been rigorously selected for health. By the inappropriate use of antibiotics
and other medications you are constructing a rod for your own back and
the back of the whole fancy.
<br>In general we only
obtain birds from people we know very well and we are very reluctant to
allow visitors that we do not know to enter our birdroom as it appears
that Megabacteria and resistant strains of bacteria as well as French molt
are now widely distributed in the fancy. Of course these bad bugs can be
transported very easily as they are invisible and do not need a passport
(not even a work permit).
<br>New birds are housed
for at least 6 weeks at a distance from our birds and observed for any
sign of sickness.
<br>A report published
in the biggest budgerigar journal of the world [see reference 2] recommended
6 (six) different products for a six week quarantine, 9 (nine) different
products for routine medication and 3 (three) additional supplements. Would
you give all this bulldust to your children? </font>

birds from a pairing or not a single one. The brothers and sisters as well
as the parents of a particular bird we would like to breed with are held
back for at least one year. Some families are kept for years. We intend
to observe each family as a whole to check for vitality, character, intelligence
and longevity. It may occur that we keep more than 15 brothers and sisters
from a distinctive bird that will never see a breeding cage from the inside.
It may also happen that after a regular evaluation of a defined family,
4 sisters from one pair are used for breeding. We endeavor to have as many

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">SM: I select based on visual qualities
and pedigree. The visual quality accounts for 80% and the pedigree for
20%. The birds I keep have to be big birds with a lot of feather. Big heads
with directional feathering and a lot of backskull is a must as well as
big shoulders to carry the massive heads. I like to see a deep mask with
evenly distributed spots and a tucked in beak. I also breed with the lesser
brothers and sisters of the top birds from other breeders that I can buy.
Selection in the aviary of a seller is as important as selection in my
own aviary. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: Selection of the breeding birds is
absolutely vital and mandatory for your stud. Our sele<font color="#111111">ction method is very
simple. We breed with the best birds from the best families.
The characteristics we are looking for are balance, balance and balance. The
birds have to be good flyers with a lot of temperament and they have to
come from fertile families on both sides of the pedigree. Our definition
of fertility is simple. We require a pair of birds to rear at least a total
of 9 chicks in three subsequent rounds before the offspring is considered
for a breeding program. The</font> mean clutch size has to be greater than six
eggs. These are the prerequisites before we start to think about the standard
of excellence. Of course we do not breed with featherless birds that have
three legs or more than two heads. However in some odd cases we breed with
peculiar birds simply because we like them without considering the above
mentioned rules. The budgerigars we buy are normally in this category.
We also realized that we have the tendency to breed with offspring from
birds that have been bought. Our excuse is very lucid. We believe that
these birds are very special and belong to the category of ravishing birds
that are simply exquisite and therefore valuable. This is a perfect mirror
of human nature and we are not willing to fight it even though we should
anticipate breeding problems in the future. </font>

Techniques</font></b><font face="Arial"> </font></font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">SM: My aim is to breed quality in quantity
therefore I am a great disciple of related pairings if the original birds
are of real quality. Aunt to nephew, uncle to niece or cousin to cousin
are preferred matings. I do not pair birds with similar faults such as
flecked birds, birds with hinged tails or small masks. The starting point
for developing a winning line or family in my hands is always a good cock
that is fertile and prepotent. This cock will be mated to 4 or 5 related
hens in the first season to produce halfsiblings for the next year. Mating
of these halfsiblings together provides me with the nucleus of a winning
line. Occasionally these birds can be mated back to the original cock to
fix established characteristics. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">F<font color="#111111">M: We are great
believers in assortative matings or mating of phenotypi</font>cally similar
birds. It is more likely that these birds carry the same or similar alleles
for the desired morphology. However the more you try to cover the deficiencies
in one bird with good qualities in another, the less the birds will have
in common. If results are not satisfactory you should not blame assortative
mating as that is no longer what you are doing. Peer reviewed data on inbreeding
in budgerigars are very rare and results are controversial as the observed
heterogeneity in response to inbreeding, resulting in increased or decreased
reproductive success, may be attributed to environmental differences or
to the history of individual strains [see reference 3]. So far we have
not had the opportunity to start a defined inbreeding program as the backgrounds
of the individual birds in question are not fully known or not satisfactory.
Inbreeding with birds of unknown origin is a high risk and a short term
project only, as it is known from experiments in mice that at least 95%
of all lines started will disappear within 8 to 10 generations.
<br>It is very difficult to forecast the outcome
of a short term inbreeding program and it is impossible to predict the
outcome of a long term inbreeding program.
<br>The only sensible starting point for a
winning line of exhibition budgerigars should therefore be several pairs
of birds that are from a very well established line with a known history.
The best method to breed consistently outstanding birds is to start with
outstanding birds from outstanding breeders. These birds are very scarce
and are not commonly for sale. To circumvent this problem you may apply
another well established method: the fat wallet <font color="#111111">method. The fat wallet
method does not work with Fallows as prepotent Fallows from established
lines are not available.
<br>Often breeding theories are reflecting
the fantasy of the breeders not the facts that pass reasonable scrutiny.
It is very human that we often confuse fantasy with
experience, wishful thinking with success and myths with knowledge. Based
on our experience we concluded that three very important rules are fundamental
to all success. Unfortunately they are not known. In the meanwhile we apply&nbsp;

the best breeding technique that is successful on long term. This method
is known as the KISS method: Keep It Simple Stupid. </font></font>

method for breeding marvelous Fallows?</font></b><font face="Arial"> </font>
</font> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">SM: I have a large number of good budgerigars
in all the mainstream colors. The Fallow gene is recessive to normal, therefore
I use the standard method for improving recessives. I pair the best visual
Fallows with the best outcross available. The best split young Fallow can
then be paired either with split Fallows or with Fallows from the top of
the stud. It is a long way to go. To improve budgerigars in general I use
Darkgreens for the color, Greygreens for the size, Opalines for the spots
and Spangles for the fertility. Flecked birds carry the feather I want
and to dilute the flecking I use Cinnamon that weakens the color and is
beneficial in removing flecking. Unfortunately the Fallow gene is very
weak and it is difficult to keep it balanced. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: The best way is to obtain Fallows from
an exhibition stud, Fallows that have been bred by accident without previous
knowledge of the genetic makeup of the parents.
<br>We acquired our first pair of Fallows
from a pet shop. I regularly visit the pet shops in town and one day I
saw for the first time five German Fallows. The overall quality of the
birds was miserable. The birds were small and flighty. In addition they
were housed together with Agapornis and Cockatiels and most of the budgerigars
had missing toes and were crippled. As Christmas day was close I nevertheless
bought two German Fallows out of curiosity: A cock in Opaline Violet and
a hen in Cobalt. Today we believe that it was a very good present as one
year later we already enjoyed 30 budgerigars split for Fallow in our aviary.
The Fallow cock paired to an Opaline Cobalt hen split Dilute raised 8 chicks
and the Fallow hen paired to a blue cock that was split for Opaline raised
22 chicks in 3 rounds. A feature of the hen we particularly liked was the
merit that she only stopped laying eggs when the first chick had hatched.
Therefore clutch sizes have varied between 9 (first round) and 13 (second
round). The maximal number of chicks raised was 9 (second round). We decided
to stop breeding after three rounds even though the birds were still in
excellent condition. We kept all the split Fallows for at least one year
to select the best for future breeding and the 22 chicks have been used
to evaluate the inheritance of physical features. The length of all birds,
including the parents, was measured and plotted onto a graph. We anticipated
that the length of the birds would be normally distributed. The size of
the cock was 24cm compared to the 21cm of the hen. At this stage we only
took into account the size of the birds ignoring their exhibition qualities.
The cock was a good exhibition bird compared to the pet type hen.
<br>The mean size of the offspring was 20.3cm
with a standard deviation of 1.4cm (see below). The type of the chicks
was not improved as they looked like their mother (small, thin, narrow
face, small spots). </font>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">We concluded from these obse<font color="#111111">rvations that
most of the traits that define the size (and probably also other exhibition
features) are not dominant at all.
<br>The strategy described below we used to
improve our Fallows is a logical consequence of these observations and
may be applied to all recessive traits. </font>We want to keep the characteristics,
such as fertility, that are often related to small birds and we aim to
introduce the required exhibition features as well. </font>

your exhibition stud.

<br>2.) <b><font color="#FF0000">I</font></b>ntroduction
of desired genes (from exhibition birds) to birds with the rare trait (in
split form). From these pairings no visual Fallows will be bred and you
will not know whether your birds are carriers of the Fallow gene or not.
These pairings are the key to your success later one.
<br>3.) <b><font color="#FF0000">D</font></b>etermination
of the carrier status of your birds. All birds from the above mentioned
pairings have to be paired with Fallows. The resulting visual Fallows will
be used for control pairings. Only the split Fallows that have now been
confirmed are used in your future breeding program.
<br>4.) <b><font color="#FF0000">A</font></b>nalyze
your progress. Compare the visual quality of your split birds with the
quality of your best birds. If you are happy with the small improvements
repeat steps 2.) to 4.). </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">With this method the progress will be slow
within the first years but sensational afterwards. You will need a lot
of visual Fallows for control pairings but do not be tempted to pair the
split Fallows together before you are happy with the visual quality of
your splits. Do not expect progress by pairing Fallows to split Fallows.
The most valuable birds for your breeding program are the birds that are
split for Fallow.
<br>The key to success will be the fertility
of your birds as you expect to perform only one round for your control
pairings and you need large numbers of offspring to select the birds with
the desired characteristics. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">SM: The quality of the cocks is the most
important part in a pairing. Good cocks can transmit their features to
cocks and hens as well. Good cocks can be mated for several years with
several hens each year resulting in many half-sisters and half-brothers
that will be the basis for building a winning line or even a winning stud.
I prefer to buy good cocks as outcrosses and I aim to breed typey hens
myself. My preference for good cocks, if possible buff cocks with broad
shoulders, holds true for all budgerigar varieties including Fallows. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: If we are biased then we are not only
slightly biased in favor of the hens. Good hens or even better a handful
of good sisters of real quality are the motor for a successful breeding
program. We started to breed Fallows with two single birds only. The offspring
of the cock were used to breed more Fallows for experimental and control
pairings. In these cases we bred with cocks and hens. The offspring of
the hen were used differently. To upgrade the Fallows with the above mentioned
AIDA strategy we only used hens from this mating. There are plenty of reasons
for this. The foundation hen did not stop laying eggs before the first
chick was hatched. We wanted to keep and propagate this exceptional peculiarity
in our stud. The only way to assess the inheritance of this<font color="#111111"> feature is
by using female offspring. Unfortunately this trait was never ever found
in the offspring. The minimal number of chicks fledged per clutch was 6.
We knew that the cock that was mated to the Fallow
hen was very fertile, because he was testmated before, but we also hoped
that this hen could store semen for a prolonged time as is claimed in the
literature (?). Furthermore, it is known that specific genetic information
is only carried by the hen. A part of this information is only found on
the Y chromosome of the female bird. In addition very important information
that is necessary for the generation of metabolic energy in the mitochondria
of every cell, is passed to the offspring via the hen only. Mitochondria
are very small organelles that represent the power plants of cells and
we speculate that they are partially accountable for the temperament of
the birds too. The information for the functioning of these power
plants is also carried in the motile germ cells of the males but is lost
during the fertilization of the egg. Last but not least we intended to</font> breed preferentially Opaline Fallows. Only a part of the hens carried the
Opaline factor. In fact we started the upgrading of our Fallows with 5
Opaline hens that were split Fallow. All these hens were daughters of our
foundation hen. </font>

</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">SM: Feathering, especially directional
feathering, is difficult to improve. I divide my budgerigars into three
standard categories: yellow, intermediate and buff and I aim to have in
all pairings a buff partner with coarse feathers. My preferred picks are
normally buff cocks as buff hens tend to be poor breeders. Following these
principles my Fallows are paired to buff partners in most cases and consequently
feathers have been improved over the years. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: In our opinion the yellow-intermediate-buff
theory is a very attractive concept that was adopted too quickly in the
fancy. The broad phenotypical classification of feathers into these three
categories is an oversimplification and in the final consequence meaningless.
To add to the confusion many fanciers realized this and added even more
categories such as medium buff and super buff. Feathers are very complex
structures and length, shape, width, thickness, down, structure of barbs
and shafts all contribute to the final appearance of the bird. The inheritance
of feather structures is in our eyes the least understood aspect of breeding
show budgerigars. Beside this the bone structure, the skeletal dimensions
and the muscularity are so important for the first and the lasting impression.
Of course the length of feathers is a prerequisite to have a deep mask,
and width is important in order to have good spots, but we are not part
of those feather specialists who can talk about feathers and the heredity
of feathers for hours. Feather analysis is not important in our breeding
program. Our Fallows have feathers and that’s it.
<br>Fallows do have very silky feathers compared
to feathers of Normal budgerigars. We have shown that Fallows can be recognized
by handling alone. Our experiment was very simple: We presented to a friend
several times a pair of Fallow and Normal nestfeathers. His task was to
determine the Fallow. In all 50 (fifty) trials he succeeded. Our friend
is blind. He failed to find the Cinnamons in a similar experiment. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">SM: There are basic principles independent
of which variety is being exhibited and judged. A good budgerigar has to
be as close as possible to the standard of perfection. A good head with
no flecking, broad shoulders, deep masks together with color and markings
are very important. Today the biggest Fallows are winning independent of
other considerations. This will remain acceptable until such time as the
gap between first class budgerigars and the Fallows is filled. Color considerations
are not important at this stage. I am not a judge myself but I have no
problems entering my birds under a judge who does not keep Fallows. One
day you will win and one day you will lose. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: We are happy to breed good Fallows
and we breed and exhibit for fun, not to please judges. We enter the birds
under all judges. Exhibition is all about promotion. We promote the varieties
that interest us and we promote ourselves. We never overlook the fact that
exhibition is all about blowing trumpets but this is very human and an
allegory of human life itself. However, the most important aspects in breeding
exhibition budgerigars are the social aspects. There are some terrific
blocks out there and it is a pleasure to share such a wonderful hobby with
them. We have had a lot of success with our Fallows so far. Our birds won
Best in Show and Best Opposite Sex in Show at the by far biggest One Bird
Show of the world (2 entries). The Best in Show was an Australian Pied
double factor Goldenface Fallow Cobalt hen and Best Opposite Sex in Show
was a double factor Spangle Darkgreen Opaline Fallow. Our birds also won
several times the Worst in Show award as they were so far behind in type
and size. Fortunately all the birds in front were disqualified as our society
also included a doping control that consisted of a very simple test. All
the birds in the final lineup at the show had to prove that they were capable
of flying a distance of 10 feet. It was a disaster if not to say a tragedy
that we did not expect. All the birds (chicken) failed with one exception:
Our CC winning Fallow budgerigar. Trumpeting is over now. We suggest that
similar doping tests should likewise be performed at all the major shows,
especially the shows under the patronage of the BS, otherwise the abbreviation
CCC&nbsp; could be misinterpreted as Chicken Challenge Certificate. </font>

<br>The journey to best in show is more entertaining
when one has an inkling of how to do it. Please convince me that the AIDA
strategy is working as the proof of the breeding is the exhibiting not
the trumpeting. </font> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: I perfectly agree. As mentioned above
we started breeding Fallows with two pet shop budgerigars. This is the
perfect situation to assess our AIDA concept as it is difficult to imagine
more lamentable birds to start with. Today we believe that we are in the
lucky position, for the first time, of being able to directly compare the
AIDA strategy with the standard method suggested by Mike Scaly.
<br>As mentioned before the first generation
splits with “50% exhibition blood” were of calamitous quality. The second
generation splits “75% exhibition blood” that have been bred from these
birds (mating with exhibition stock and mandatory testmating) are clearly
ahead of the Fallows that have been bred, by mating of the first generation
splits with Fallows (=> resulting in birds with “25% exhibition blood”),
as far as exhibition points are concerned (head, spots, type). These “75%”
splits are however still miles away from good exhibition stock. Interestingly
we found that within these second generation birds the carriers of the
Fallow gene were the most ugly birds of all. Our best six “75% exhibition
blood” hens and the three best males did not carry the Fallow gene. We
do not know whether this is coincidence or not. This observation may indicate
that the Fallow gene is (of course!) still linked to undesirable traits
that are not assisting the improvement we are looking for. These linked
traits will be separated in future generations by crossing over. A very
strict selection at this point is not yet appropriate. We bred our third
generation splits (“88% exhibition blood”) with these second-rate birds.
This is a typical situation of a “pedigree only” based selection that does
not consider the phenotype of the birds: A dilemma that we face again during
the breeding of the fourth generation. Therefore we use for the first time
split Fallow cocks in the process of upgrading. This will increase the
number of birds that can compete for the breeding pen and give some hints
about the role of the X chromosome to influence showtype. </font>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">By breeding with Fallows indeed. Our testmating
procedure is very simple. In a testmating with a Fallow at least three
chicks have to be reared and if no Fallows appear then we consider the
birds not to be split Fallow. The probability that we miss a carrier of
the Fallow gene is reduced to 12% (1 out of 8) with a minimal number of
three chicks. If four chicks are bred the probability is down to 6%. The
results of a given testmating are already visible immediately after hatching
(red eyes!) and the confirmed split Fallow birds can be prepared for the
mating with exhibition stock very smoothly without the necessity to rear
full clutches of substandard Fallows. </font>

<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Are split Fallows that have been 'washed'
through normals more capable of producing quality?</font></b><font size="2" face="Arial">
</font> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: Yes, if the normals have been of exhibition
quality. Why? Because in general the Fallows lack most of the exhibition
qualities and therefore lack also the genes that carry the information
for these qualities. All the missing genetic information required “to construct”
an exhibition bird have to be introduced from outside into our Fallows. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><i><font size="2" face="Arial">A simplified model:</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2">
<br>Imagine that only 10 independent recessive
genes are required to define a show bird. A perfect show bird has 10 pairs
of these recessive genes that are missing in the Fallows. In the first
generation all the offspring will be split Fallow. All these birds carry
exactly 10 single copies of the recessive genes in split form. The birds
will not be improved at all because not a single one of these recessive
genes is in double form (to be effective). If you pair these split Fallows
together some of the offspring will show small improvements compared to
the Fallows and the split Fallows. This is not a surprise as the recessive
genes found in the mother and in the father will randomly combine, resulting
in Fallows that may carry two copies of one or more of these 10 recessive
genes. But one gene in double form is not enough: In this simple model
you need ten! These small improvements mentioned above will be minimal
if you relate it with your ambitions. Don’t be fooled by the small visible
progresses. Genetically the “improved” bird from these matings is not capable
of producing good offspring. Most of the “showtype” genes are still missing.
<br>However, if you pair split Fallows (with
10 recessive genes each) from the first generation again to exhibition
birds (with a double dose of the recessive genes) then it is obvious that
the probability that two corresponding recessive genes will combine in
a chick is increased. The required genes (all of them!) are found on both
sides of this mating. In contrast, by breeding these splits to Fallows
you diminish the small amount of “good genes” you introduced in the parental
mating. Mission impossible. </font>
<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">In the case of split Fallows from the first
generation, the average number of the required recessive genes that will
be distributed to individual germ cells (eggs or spermatozoides) during
meiosis is 5 (out of 10) as the total amount of genes is divided by two.
The exact distribution of these independent genes is not predictable. In
some germ cells you may have 3, 4, 5, 6 or even 7 out of these 10 genes.
If you select (by chance) the offspring that received 7 genes from the
split Fallow parent (the probability is 12%) you will be surprised by the
quality of the offspring. However, the probability is also 12% that only
3 out of 10 recessive genes are found in an individual germ cell. As you
have no tools to determine the carrier status of the maybe splits, you
are advised to test all your maybe splits not only for the presence of
the Fallow gene, but also for the presence of required “show type” genes.
This selection can be done visually. In contrast, the carrier status of
your split Fallow for “show type” genes cannot be assessed if the birds
are crossed back to Fallows or split Fallows.
<br>At this stage you have to face minor disadvantages.
You will not breed one hundred Fallows in the first season and you will
not know whether the chicks produced are split Fallow or not. But most
importantly, you will see for the first time the hidden genetic quality
of your split Fallows in the quality distribution of their chicks (BIG-DOT
effect). This is theoretically and practically the only way forward with
most of the recessive varieties. Please try to estimate the probabilities
mentioned above. By using your common sense you will never look back.
<br>Start to pair your split Fallows together
when you are happy (happppy with four p's) with the quality (compared to
your best exhibition birds). Erstwhile, the Fallows you produce will be
Fallows bred from testmatings “only”. The quality of these Fallows will
improve slowly with the quality of your splits too. However, this is not
quick enough. Go for the splits and mate the splits with your best exhibition
birds. This strategy only works when you have enough fertile and fit Fallows
for testmating. The time you invest for testmating is not lost. The time
to invest for testmating will be six weeks maximally for males and three
months for hens. Results can be analyzed immediately after hatching. The
speed of your progress will be dramatically increased later on.
<br>This “10 genes only” model is an oversimplification,
and it may be anticipated that several hundred of recessive and also dominant
genes, that are in several cases also linked, may be responsible for the
differences in the type of budgerigars. (In dogs<font color="#111111"> it is estimated that roughly
500 genes are responsible for the characteristic differences between dog
breeds.) This model is, however, good enough to illustrate
the advantages of the AIDA strategy and this model can also explain why
it is so important to breed large amounts of chicks from individual pairs
to optimize selection. </font></font>

<p style="margin:0 5; "><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: Exhibition budgerigars tend to mature
slowly compared to pet type birds. This is not surprising. Today our Fallows
do not show delayed maturity. They develop in parallel to their normal
siblings. Fallow hens (and also their normal sisters) have nut-brown ceres
at six months already. At this age most of them are in breeding condition.
Our Fallows seem to develop perfectly normally from the first day on.
<br>However, if we speculate that one of the
three confirmed Fallow genes is homologous to the pink-eyed dilution locus
p of the mouse [see reference 4], then it is not surprising that certain
strains of Fallows show dramatically increased chick mortality as described
in the literature. For comparison: In mice more then thirty different mutations
of the pink-eyed locus are known. Most of them have problems associated
with reproduction (sterility in males, juvenile lethality mild to severe).
Similar dramatic observations have been made in mice with mutations of
the tyrosinase gene Tyr, another candidate for a Fallow locus within others

Fallows are 4.8 &plusmn; 2.9 and 1.6 &plusmn; 2.4. Split Fallows produced
an average of 2.7 &plusmn; 3.1 chicks from 6.4 &plusmn; 3.1 eggs. It is
clear that Fallows and split Fallows perform not worse compared to Normals.
Such data are psychologically very important and indicate indeed that these
Fallows are in good shape and healthy. The presence of the Fallow gene
is not detrimental to the reproductive success.

<br>The question about the number of different
Fallow genes and their mechanism of action is still not answered yet. Maybe
one day the sequencing of the budgerigar genes that are understood to be
involved in color production (e.g. Tyrosinase, pink-eyed locus transporter
protein e.o.) will give us the answer. These data from the sequencing could
provide the Fallow breeders with a tool to assess the carrier status of
maybe splits by DNA fingerprinting without testmating. Science Fiction

<p style="margin-left: 5; margin-right: 5"><font size="2" face="Arial">FM: Fallow budgerigars are beautiful birds.
The exhibition quality is nevertheless still poor. Exhibition budgerigars
cannot be improved by using Fallows.
<br>However, Fallows might be useful to solve
an enigma that is related to the Yellowface varieties and the Blue allele(s).
So far nobody has proven (sorry Mr. Ken Gray) without any doubt that all
Yellowfaces (Goldenface, Yellowface mutant 1, Yellowface mutant 2) are
multiple alleles of the same Blue locus.
<br>Why should a double factor Yellowface
mutant 1 become blue? We prefer the alternative Yellowface model that was
first published in the Internet by Peter Bergman of Sydney speculating
that the Yellowface mutant 1 birds (Creamfaces) are a composite variety
of two different Blue alleles. The Yellowface topic is highly controversial
as fanciers of world fame still believe that the Yellowface factor can
be carried by birds of the Green series (e.g. the legendary Goldenface
Lutinos). Only a few people grasp the “<a target="_blank" href="http://www.birdhobbyist.com/parrotcolour/peter/yface01.html">Bergman
model</a>” and only a handful think about it. We are currently mating Yellowface
mutant 1 budgerigars with Goldenfaces to check whether it is possible to
distinguish between the Goldenfaces that are split for the common Blue
allele and the Goldenfaces that are split for the “Bergman Blue” allele.
These experiments are funny as some of the Goldenfaces are split Danish
Pied and some of the Creamfaces are split Clearwing. We are looking forward
to find some Yellowface Danish Pied Clearwings popping out, a horror combination
for the budgerigar purists. If it is not possible to see differences between
these two Goldenface forms on a Normal background it may be possible to
see these differences on a Fallow background or on an Albino background.
In this case Fallows maybe helpful to introduce a new budgerigar mutation,
namely the “Bergman Blue", and to define a new composite variety, namely
the Creamface, formerly called Yellowface mutant 1. Can we observe differences
in the color distribution (e.g. yellow spillage) or in the color intensity
(e.g. head, wing feathers, tail feathers) in the resulting single factor
Goldenfaces? Can we observe differences before and after the molt? Can
these differences be attributed to the carrier status of the birds?
<br>And so what?
<br>Neither the traditional nor the "Bergman"
approach can be excluded by the observation of these differences alone.
<br>And so what? <font color="#111111">
<br>Based on our observations we suggest that
"Goldenface breeders should preferentially breed with the “Bergman Blue"
budgerigars, that are identical to the so called "double factor Yellowface
mutant 1" budgerigars, to breed nice "yellowfaced single factor Goldenfaces"
that do not show yellow spillage".<span lang="de-ch"> </span> </font></font>
