Personally I've been favouring bloodline, it gives you more in depth quality. But you obviously have to consider the quality of the bird itself. Finding both is impossible but you can find it partially.

To give you an example: I've recently bought an outcross cock from probably (one of) the best local breeder. The width of the head could be better and I could probably have found a bird with a wider head from another breeder. But on the other hand it had a very good mask and spots. Almost all of his birds have this feature (and also very good heads).

My stud needed improvement in spots and mask so I was looking specifically for this feature. For this feature I wanted to get both visual quality and bloodline in order to be able to succesfully spread this feature in my stud.

As for the with of face I'm hoping some of the head quality of the bloodline is still present in the outcross and of course I'm going to mate him to my hens with the widest head (he's already getting friendly with my best hen).
