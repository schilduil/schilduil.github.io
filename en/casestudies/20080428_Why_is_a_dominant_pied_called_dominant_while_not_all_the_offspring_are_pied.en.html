<p><i>So my questions is, why is the dominant pied called dominant? How can it be considered dominant if there are a certain percentage of normal chicks produced? I would have thought dominant pied meant that it was dominant over any other colour? Or does it merely mean it is a dominant version of the the pied gene, as apposed to the recessive pied gene? I am confused?</i></p>

<p>First dominant pied and recessive pied are completely different mutations and are genetically not related. That's the first element causing confusion.</p>

<p>Dominant indeed is on the gene level. Birds have (almost) all genes in pairs. Let's call the dominant pied gene <b>P</b>. The normal version of this gene (i.e. not pied) is <b>P<sup>+</sup></b>. If a bird has both type of this gene: so one normal (<b>P<sup>+</sup></b>) and one pied (<b>P</b>): <b>P<sup>+</sup></b>/<b>P</b>, the definition of dominant is that you will see that colour in the bird. In this case dominant pied.</p>

<p>For a recessive mutation like blue (<b>bl</b>) it's the other way round. A bird that is normal and blue: <b>bl<sup>+</sup></b>/<b>bl</b> will be normal as the blue is recessive.</p>

<p>Now why does a dominant pied when paired to a normal produce both normals and pieds? Well, the pied has the genes <b>P<sup>+</sup></b>/<b>P</b> and the normal has the genes <b>P<sup>+</sup></b>/<b>P<sup>+</sup></b> (both normal, otherwise it would be a pied). Now the offspring will be a combination of both parents, so you need to combine the genes of the father with a gene of the mother. In this example there are two possible combianations: <b>P<sup>+</sup></b>/<b>P<sup>+</sup></b> and <b>P</b>/<b>P<sup>+</sup></b>, or normal and pied.</p>

<p>Now birds with two dominant pied genes exists: <b>P</b>/<b>P</b>. These are pied birds (with bigger pied pathes). And these will produce 100% pieds when paired to a normal.</p>

<p>Hope this helped,<br />
